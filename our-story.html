                <p>
                    In the fateful year of 2017, destiny had a plan for us, 
                    and the NYSC (National Youth Service Corps) camp became 
                    the stage where our love story unfolded. The campgrounds 
                    provided the backdrop for our potential, and it was there 
                    that Ihuoma and I first crossed paths. We were both 
                    actively engaged in the three-week camp hosted by Anambra 
                    State NYSC, and it was an experience that would shape our 
                    future in ways we couldn't have imagined.
                </p>
        
                <p>
                    We found ourselves in the same squad nominated for the 
                    swearing-in ceremony parade, and as fate would have it, I had 
                    the honor of leading that squad. Shortly after, I was 
                    promoted to the role of General Parade Commander, making 
                    me the No. 1 Corps member. Meanwhile, Ihuoma joined the 
                    parade band, showcasing her own unique talents and charm.

                <p>
                    It was clear to both of us that there was a powerful 
                    chemistry between us, but we couldn't predict what lay ahead 
                    once the camp ended. Ihuoma was a remarkable woman - cool, 
                    classy, and spontaneous. I never thought I was on her level, 
                    and I was hesitant to approach her. She was not only beautiful 
                    but also intelligent, cheerful, sweet, and always had a 
                    charming smile on her face. Although I managed to collect 
                    her phone number during our time at camp, I was too nervous 
                    to call her. Regrettably, I lost her contact when my phone 
                    was stolen.

                    Our paths crossed once again at a town hall meeting hosted 
                    by the Governor of the State, and this time, I made sure to 
                    collect her number and safeguard it, determined not to lose 
                    it again. Our service year eventually came to an end, and we 
                    went our separate ways, unsure if we'd ever meet again.

                    A year and some months later, I couldn't get her out of my 
                    mind. Knowing that I was quite recognizable due to my role 
                    as the parade commander, I decided to reach out. When she 
                    heard from me, Ihuoma was delighted, and our conversations 
                    rew. I always made it clear that I was genuinely interested 
                    in her, even though I still felt nervous because of the way 
                    she carried herself.

                    On November 25, 2022, she noticed a WhatsApp status of mine that 
                    read, "Even if her profile says TAKEN, still DM her, she might be 
                    TAKEN for GRANTED." Her response was a simple "lol," and that 
                    opened the door for me to engage further. I entered her DM with a 
                    mixture of care, a sprinkle of love, inquiries about her, and a 
                    shoulder to cry on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our journey began, despite the distance that separated us - Umuahia 
                    and Abuja. On January 23rd, we officially started dating, and on 
                    July 18th, I proposed. Then, on October 7th, we celebrated our love 
                    with a traditional marriage. Our families exchanged gifts, shared food, 
                    and contacts, while our parents blessed our union with their prayers.
